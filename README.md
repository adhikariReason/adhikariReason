# About-me
# Reason Adhikari

## Current
I am a Junior working on Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Information Systems.

## Background
I am from Ilam, Nepal.I don't have any prior industry experience but I have been working on few of my personal projects. I find Astronomy fascinating so I like to explore things online about technologies used in spacecrafts and possibilities of deep space exploration during my spare time.

## Plans
I haven't decided what I want to go for but initially would love to start as software developer.
